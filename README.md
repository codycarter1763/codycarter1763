# Hi, I’m Cody 👋

I’m a **Computer Engineering student at Louisiana State University** with a strong focus on embedded systems, microprocessors, and hardware logic design.

I work primarily in C/C++ on ARM-based microcontrollers including STM32 and ESP32, developing firmware that interfaces with custom hardware, communication protocols, and mixed-signal circuits. My projects often involve PCB design, hardware simulation, validating behavior using test equipment, and custom fabrication.

Outside of school and work, I combine my interest in music and engineering by designing audio hardware and embedded systems from re-engineered analog guitar pedals and DSP-based effects to embedded control projects and automation experiments. I've also designed and constructed speaker systems using computer aided technology, CNC machining, and audio physics to craft systems with the highest fidelity audio and consistent quality. 

Whether it’s school or personal projects, I’m driven by the desire to create technology that makes a difference and improve my skills. If you’re interested in collaborating or discussing anything further, lets connect to talk about it.

⚡ *Fun fact:* I trust oscilloscopes more than `printf` debugging.
