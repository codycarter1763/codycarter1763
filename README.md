I’m a **computer engineering student and embedded / firmware engineer** who enjoys building hardware that exists outside the screen — from low-level firmware and communication protocols to analog and mixed-signal circuit design.

I’m especially interested in **embedded systems, hardware–software integration, and system-level design**, and I enjoy working close to the metal where debugging involves oscilloscopes as much as code.

- Embedded firmware for **ESP32, STM32, Arduino**, and Linux-based systems  
- **Low-level C / C++** for resource-constrained environments  
- Hardware bring-up and debugging (datasheets, logic analyzers, oscilloscopes)  
- **Communication protocols**: CCSDS Space Packet Protocol, SPI, I2C, UART, CAN  
- **Audio electronics**, signal processing, and amplifier design  
- Analog, digital, and **mixed-signal circuit design**  
- Python tooling for analysis, testing, and automation  
- Raspberry Pi and Linux-based embedded platforms  
- PLC systems and industrial-style control logic  

I’m continuously learning how to design **robust, scalable embedded systems** and how to think about problems at the system architecture level rather than just individual components.

## 🧠 How I Think

- I like understanding **why** something works, not just that it works  
- I enjoy reverse-engineering circuits and protocols  
- I’m comfortable moving between schematics, firmware, and test equipment  
- I value clean, readable code *and* clean, understandable hardware

⚡ *Fun fact:* I trust oscilloscopes more than `printf` debugging.
