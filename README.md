# Hi, I’m Cody 👋

I’m a **Computer Engineering student at Louisiana State University** with a strong focus on embedded systems, microprocessors, and hardware logic design. I enjoy building hardware that lives in the real world — where firmware, electronics, and system-level debugging all meet.

I work primarily in C/C++ on ARM-based microcontrollers including STM32 and ESP32, developing firmware that interfaces with custom hardware, communication protocols, and mixed-signal circuits. My projects often involve PCB design, hardware simulation, validating behavior using test equipment, and custom fabrication.

Outside of school and work, I combine my interest in music and engineering by designing audio hardware and embedded systems from re-engineered analog guitar pedals and DSP-based effects to embedded control projects and automation experiments. I've also designed and constructed speaker systems using computer aided technology, CNC machining, and audio physics to craft systems with the highest fidelity audio and consistent quality. 

Whether it’s school or personal projects, I’m driven by the desire to create technology that makes a difference and improve my skills. If you’re interested in collaborating or discussing anything further, lets connect to talk about it.

- Embedded firmware for **ESP32, STM32, Arduino**, and Linux-based systems  
- **Low-level C / C++** for resource-constrained environments  
- Hardware bring-up and debugging (datasheets, logic analyzers, oscilloscopes)  
- **Communication protocols**: CCSDS Space Packet Protocol, SPI, I2C, UART, CAN  
- **Audio electronics**, signal processing, and amplifier design  
- Analog, digital, and **mixed-signal circuit design**  
- Python tooling for analysis, testing, and automation  
- Raspberry Pi and Linux-based embedded platforms  
- PLC systems and industrial-style control logic  

I’m continuously learning how to design **robust, scalable embedded systems** and how to think about problems at the system architecture level rather than just individual components.

## 🧠 How I Think

- I like understanding **why** something works, not just that it works  
- I enjoy reverse-engineering circuits and protocols  
- I’m comfortable moving between schematics, firmware, and test equipment  
- I value clean, readable code *and* clean, understandable hardware

⚡ *Fun fact:* I trust oscilloscopes more than `printf` debugging.
